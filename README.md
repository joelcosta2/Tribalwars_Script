# Tribalwars: Premium Features

## Description

**Tribalwars: Premium Features** is a comprehensive enhancement suite designed to elevate the Tribalwars gaming experience by unlocking utility tools typically reserved for Premium Account holders. The script streamlines empire management by introducing a fully customizable **Extra-Large Map**, an **Infinite Building Queue** and advanced automation for routine tasks like **Scavenging** and **Paladin Training**.

To optimize your workflow, the script injects a persistent sidebar on the left side of the screen. All introduced widgets are draggable and feature **state-memory**, meaning they will remember their exact position on your screen every time you log in. Whether you are a casual player or a competitive strategist, this script provides the data transparency and one-click convenience needed to manage your villages with maximum efficiency, even without a premium account.

## Key Features

### 🗺️ Map Enhancements
- **Extra Large Map:** Enjoy a larger map without premium. Toggle it on the map page and set the size freely—no limits!

## Notes

- These features currently work only in the browser and have been tested with a single account/world. Support for multiple accounts or worlds may be added in the future.
- All data is stored in the browser's local storage.
- I have no idea how it works in languages other than PT-PT. Feel free to test it and let me know! :)
- I doubt it works with different time formats...
- Some information is retrieved via AJAX calls to the relevant pages. For example, village hover info (such as recent attack details) is scraped from the corresponding report page and displayed on the map.
- I know this is basically spaghetti code, but I'm having a lot of fun getting it to work. I just wish my villages weren’t constantly being conquered—it makes it hard to test this with multiple villages. Maybe I should focus more on the game and less on the script!

Enjoy the enhanced features while playing Tribalwars!
