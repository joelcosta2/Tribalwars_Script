## Notes
This functionalities only work on the browser, and only tested with only one account/world. Maybe in the future I will add support for multiple accounts or worlds. All the information is saved on the browser cookies. 
Currently there are a few bugs, the columns, where the new assets are added, lose the hover function on some cases.


Enjoy the enhanced features while playing Tribalwars!
